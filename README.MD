The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning solution for a specific problem/task. We started by conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics.

After completing the EDA phase, we trained a machine learning model using the data. To serve the model and make predictions in a production environment, we utilized BentoML, an open-source framework for deploying machine learning models as scalable and containerized APIs.

In addition to model serving, we integrated MLflow for model tracking and experiment management. MLflow allowed us to log and track model training runs, metrics, and artifacts, providing a comprehensive view of the model development process.

## Usage

To use or extend this project, follow these steps:

1. Perform the necessary data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on your specific dataset.

2. Train your machine learning model using the provided data and appropriate algorithms or techniques.

3. Use BentoML to package and serve your trained model as an API. This allows easy integration with other systems or applications.

4. Track your model development and experiments using MLflow. Leverage the MLflow UI to visualize and analyze the logged metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
